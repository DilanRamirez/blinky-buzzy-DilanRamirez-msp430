# Lab 2: Blinky-Buzzy Toy

## Description
This toy:

* generate sounds,
* dynamically change the LEDs that are illuminated, both brighly and dimmly,
* implement a state machine to maintain the state of the toy,
* and use the four buttons on the expansion board (P2.0-3) to transition the
  state machine.

## Getting Started
To start using this example of a toy using the msp430, you can clone it
directly to your pc or virtual machine, then type make, and it will compile
all of the programs to make it work. Then, go to the directory called toy and
type in the shell "make load" which will compile and upload the code to the
msp430.
